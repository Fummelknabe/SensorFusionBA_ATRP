%
%
% Language of the thesis:
%
% You must use either 'german' or 'english' above, depending on the
% language used in the main text. This will automatically setup a lot
% of things in the background.
%
%
% Version of the class:
%
% You must specify which version of the thesis class is to be
% used. This is important in case the class style changes in later
% years, but we still want an older thesis to look the same, even when
% things are changed in the class.
%
% Do not change or remove the version-xxxx key.
%
%
% Text encoding:
%
% Your thesis *must* be encoded in utf8 (unicode), which is the
% default in most editors these days. Do *not* change this to latin8.



%%%
%
% Main setup:
%
%%%
%
% You must use the \UzLThesisSetup command to specify numerous things
% about your thesis. This includes the entries on the title page, the 
% abstracts, and the bibliography style. You do so by specifying
% so-called "values" for so-called "keys". For instance, 
% for the key "Autor" you must provide your name as the value. You do
% so by writing 'Autor = {Max Mustermann}', that is, the value is put
% into curly braces. You can use the \UzLThesisSetup command
% repeatedly and the order in which you provide the keys is not
% important. 
%
% Everything shown on the title page must be in German -- even
% if the thesis is written in English! Just insert German text for
% German keys and English text for English keys (like 'Abstract' needs
% English text, while 'Zusammenfassung' needs German text).

  % First, specify the institut or clinic at which the thesis was
  % written. You get the logo file from them (make sure it has the
  % correct size, namely the same as the example). If they do not have
  % a logo, the university's default logo is used.
  %
  % The 'verfasst' gets two arguments. Change the first to {an der}

  % thesis was mainly written 'externally' at some company or another
  % institute, point this out using 'Weitere Unterstützung'. 
  % 
  % For your own name, do *not* add things like "BSc" or "BSc

    It is not easy to write a thesis that does not only advance
    science, but that is also a pleasure to read. While the scientific
    contribution of a thesis is undoubtedly of greater importance, the
    impact of \emph{writing well} should not be underestimated: If
    the person who grades a thesis finds no pleasure in the reading,
    that person are also unlikely to find pleasure in giving outstanding
    grades. A well-written text uses good German or English phrasing with a clear and correct 
    sentence structure and language rhythm, there are no spelling
    mistakes and the author's arguments are presented in a
    clear, logical and understandable manner using well-chosen
    examples and explanations. In addition, a nice-to-read font and a
    pleasing layout are also helpful. The \LaTeX\ class presented in
    this document helps with the latter: It contains a number of
    ready-to-use designs and 
    takes care of many small typographical chores.

\section{Motivation and Related Work}
The topic of motion estimation in robotics is not new. There are alot of research projects concerning the issue 
of estimating a motion state of a robot. Most of the research effort in this field is spent on vehicles moving
in controlled environments such as ideal road conditions. The task of estimating the motion of mobile wheeled robot is significantly
more difficult if done in rough terrain or even on a road with bumps and potholes.  

The systems that were used in a lot of works trying to estimate a robots motion in uneven terrain make use of 
rather expensive hardware such as doppler radars or LIDAR. %%% CITATION NEEDED
This work differs from a lot of other related works in 
that sense, that only very basic sensory was used combined with a robot platform using an Ackermann steering geometry 
\footnote{The Ackermann steering geometry describes the geometry of a steering system used in most modern cars.}
that was build for rought terrain. 

Making good estimations of a motion state of a vehicle in uneven terrain has considerable applications. Possibly the
most predominant application of this would be an agriculteral vehicle. But more applications such as exploration rovers
in dangerous or remote environments can be easily thought of.

\section{Structure of this Thesis}

This Thesis consists of three parts. The first part describes the applied sensorfusion from a technical standpoint
and explains the methods used. This part outlines the fundamentals that are needed to understand the workings
of the algorithm aswell as the used hardware. Following this, the software that encapsulates the algorithm is briefly presented. This is kept rather
brief as it is not strictly relevant for the underlying problem. Thirdly, the evaluated results are presented, but also the
process of the evaluation itself.

\chapter{Design of the Sensorfusion}
\label{chapter-use}

Sensorfusion describes the process of combining sensor data so that the resulting information can desribe the environment
with less uncertainty and more accuracy than each individual sensor alone. The combination of sensor data expands the 
cability to sense different physical properties from the environment. The extraction of similar information such as 
position from these different sources can differentiate a lot. If similar information can be extracted from different sensors
redundancy is implied, as the quality of one sensor might not effect the quality of another that senses a different 
physical property. Therefore through sensorfusion a much more accurate estimation of the motion of a robot can be made.

The implementation of the sensorfusion is kept modifiable to allow adjustments. If the quality of one sensor
is not satisfactory its effect on the final estimation can be neglected as its output is suppressed. A consequence of 
this is that the parameterization of the algorithm is more complex as the parameter space is rather large.

At the heart of the sensorfusion is the ZED stereo camera from Stereolabs. \footnote{The functionality of this camera
is detailed in the next section.}% Add link to hardware?
This camera utilizes visual odometry to track its position and orientation. The use of visual odometry is very popular
among researchers when trying to estimate its pose. The quality of the visual odometry depends on a lot of different factors.
The goal of this work was to aid the camera when the quality of its provided information was not adequate. This is done 
through the use of several Kalman Filters. The following diagram shows an overview of the interaction of all the components
of the sensorfusion.

\section{The Hardware}

In Order to understand the functionality of the algorithm it is necessary to explain the underlying hardware. Not only 
is the sensor technology of importance but also the functionality of the actuators.

The underlying robotic platform is a converted electric quad for children. Therefore it performs excellent in outdoors scenarios

% Replace the following with your conclusion



This template document got much longer than I had initially intended
with more and more hints and comments becoming part of the text. The
reason is, of course, that writing a thesis is not easy since there
are a \emph{lot} of things to consider. However, you have six months
to write your thesis, so you stand a decent chance to get most things 
right.

Do some great scientific research now and report on it in a thesis
that is a pleasure to read. 




% Normally, the bibliography comes next at this point. Do *not* (try
% to) include further indices and tables like an index or
% a list of figures or a list of tables or such things. Nobody
% actually uses them and they just use up space. 
%
% You *can* however include a glossary, if this seems appropriate. It
% goes here as an unnumbered chapter. Most thesis will *not* need a
% glossary: a well-written text (re)explains strange words and
% concepts as necessary. However, there are situations where a
% glossary may be helpful.














%%%
% 
% Bibliographies
%
%%%
%
% The uzl-thesis class will load biblatex for the bibliography
% management. This is a powerful package, see its documentation for
% details. The styles will be setup correctly and automatically by
% choosing one of the two style keys as described earlier.
%
% In order for the bibliography to work, run latex in the following
% order (which is the standard order):
% 
% > lualatex thesis-example
% > bibtex thesis-example
% > lualatex thesis-example
% 
% Add BibTeX files using \addbibresource or use the {bibtex entries}
% environment (see below).
%
%%%
%
% Although everyting is normally setup automatically, you can change
% the options passed to biblatex using the key 'biblatex';
% for instance,
%
%   \UzLThesisSetup{biblatex={firstinits=false}}
%
% will switch off shortened first names. Normally, you will not need
% this key in your preamble. 
% 
% Note that the bibtex program is used as the 'backend' of biblatex
% by default (rather than biber, which is the preferred program of
% biblatex). This means that you can (and must) run *bibtex* after you
% have run lualatex on your thesis. If you wish to use biber instead
% of bibtex, say 'biblatex={backend=biber}'. 
% 
%%%
%
% The following environment is optional. It allows you to keep the
% bibtex entries for your thesis right here in the thesis file. What
% happens is that each time this tex file is processed, the contents
% of the following environment gets written to the file
% \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib (this file gets overwritten each
% time). Independently, \addbibresource{\jobname-bibtex-entries.bib}
% is always called if the file \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib
% exists. 
%
% In result, you can edit and keep the bibliography's bibtex entries
% right here. If you change something here, run latex, then bibtex,
% then latex once more.
%
% If you would like to manage the bibtex entries in a separate file,
% remove the below environment, delete the \jobname-bibtex-entries.bib
% file and instead write
%
% \addbibresource{filename-of-your-bibtex-file.bib}
%
% in the preamble.
