# SensorFusionBA_ATRP
Sensor Fusion Design and Evaluation for Robot Motion Estimation in Uneven Terrain

ISSUES:
- Plot window should be scalable
- Recentering of Plots (give same view as restart)
- After Disconnecting, no reconnecting possible
    -> Restart required 

TODO:
- Attach IMU
- Display recorded data:
    - > Plot Position in positional graph
    - > Display raw data
- Maybe seperate code in different modules
- Create mathematical model of robot
    - > Implement Kalman Filter, propably extended
