# SensorFusionBA_ATRP
Sensor Fusion Design and Evaluation for Robot Motion Estimation in Uneven Terrain

ISSUES:
- Plot window should be scalable
- Recentering of Plots
- After Disconnecting, no reconnecting possible

TODO:
- Attach IMU
- Maybe seperate code in different modules
- Create mathematical model of robot
    -> Implement Kalman Filter, propably extended
